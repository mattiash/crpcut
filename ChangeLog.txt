2009-12-15 0.8.4 (a.k.a. 1.0-RC2)

         * Improved error reporting when a test case spawns a
           child process which runs crpcut code.

         * Allow the use of INFO and FAIL streamers also for
           objects which lacks output stream operator (by printing
           a hex dump of the memory region.)

         * Improved readability of hex-dumps for large objects.

         * Complemented the XML version of the statistics block
           to include selected_test_cases and untested_test_cases
           (both as unsigned integers.) Since this is purely an
           addition, the XML-schema change is not expected to
           break any XSLT processing of the result.

         * Fixed an internal bug that caused a pipe to be
           double-closed.

2009-12-07 0.8.3 (a.k.a. 1.0-RC1)

         * The most visible update is the documentation, which received
           a total remake. Read online on http://crpcut.sourceforge.net,
           or download it separately (link on the homepage.)

         * You no longer need to access crpcut functions through
           the crpcut::test_case_factory singleton. Functions exist
           directly under namespace crpcut.

         * Fixed a bug with regular expression which wrongly reported
           out of memory on some patterns.

         * Fixed a bug when a test case forked a child process, and
           misbehaved. If the child never died, the test case became
           a zombie and would hold up crpcut indefinitely. If the
           child executed crpcut macros, the engine got confused
           beyond all hope of recovery.

         * Yet a namespace pollution was cleaned up.

         * Adding new descriptions to libraries when creating wrapper
           functions is simplified. Please see the documentation for
           details. Unfortunately this change breaks existing code,
           but it does fortunately not require much editing.

         * Minor improvements to some error reports.

2009-11-15 0.8.2 (a.k.a. 1.0-beta-3)

         * Fixed accidental namespace pollution that unfortunately
           prohibited a number of perfectly reasonable test case names.

         * Improved error reporting from EXPECT_EXCEPTION when the
           exception thrown is of the wrong type, but inherits from
           std::exception

         * Fixed separation if log-items in text test reports.

2009-11-04 0.8.1 (a.k.a. 1.0-beta-2)

         * Delayed hooking with Google test reporter until test case starts,
           which avoids a spurious SIGSEGV at exit in some circumstances.

         * Fixed bug in calloc(), which wrote to NULL when memory allocation
           failed.

         * Fixed error reporting when heap-failures were discovered outside
           of test cases.

2009-11-01 0.8.0 (a.k.a. 1.0-beta-1)

         * crpcut has entered Beta stage!

         * Google-mock support is now official instead of a dirty hack.
           Only google-mock 1.4.0 and later is supported. The support lib
           libcrpcut-gmock.so no longer exists. The CMake option
           -DWITH_GOOGLE_MOCK=yes now only controls whether google-mock
           tests shall be included in selftest. It is otherwise not needed.

         * Added heap-management, through which you can query the heap
           for allated objects and allocated bytes. You can also limit
           the available heap to test out-of-memory situations. The crpcut
           heap instruments valgrind (http://valgrind.org) if available,
           to aid search for memory leaks.

         * Build support is simplified. crpcut detects the compiler used,
           and adapts at compile time. It is no longer necessary to add
           flags like -Ddecltype=typeof or -std=c++0x.

         * Support for Intel C++ compiler ICC
           http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers/

         * Improved readability on the test result reports. Unfortunately
           this includes a slight change to the XML-schema for XML-output.
           See crpcut.xsd.

2009-10-19 0.7.3

         * Added support for google-mock 1.4.0

2009-10-15 0.7.2

         * Small bugfixes and reduced memory footprint

2009-10-11 0.7.0

         * Added support for tests to have dependencies to testsuites, and
           for testsuites to have dependencies to tests and other testsuites.

         * Added support for ULPS difference tests for floating point values.

         * Changed command line support for single tests in the main process
           for debugging.

           Use "-s testname" (for single shot) instead of "-c 0 -n" to run
           a single test case in the main process.

         * Fixed comparison between pointers and 0 in ASSERT macros.

         * Fixed comparison between pointers to members and 0 in ASSERT macros.

         * Fixed support for static const integer/enum members in ASSERT macros
           without forcing instantiation.

         * Fixed support for non-copyable types in ASSERT macros.

         * Fixed support for stream manipulatiors in INFO/FAIL stream macros.

         * Fixed a bug in the heap of test cases violating their maximum allowed
           time.


2009-04-06 0.6.2

         * Fixed ASSERT_* for non copyable objects

         * Fixed ASSERT_EQ for pointer values

         * Fixed hex dump formatting

         * Fixed printing of pointer values

         * Fixed 2728096 - Support test programs compiled with
           -fno-exceptions with gcc. No-exception support with other
           compilers is still lacking.

         * Fixed numerous warnings (some were real bugs)

         * Fixed include path bug

         * Added -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={release,debug,maint}

         * Much improved CMakeLists.txt making use of --std=c++0x
           if available

         * Moved match_traits<> out of namespace crpcut::datatypes
           to namespace crpcut. Sorry for the inconvenience.

2009-03-31 0.6.1

         * Added missing includes to crpcut.hpp

2009-03-31 0.6.0

         * Fixed broken wrapping of select()

         * Improved exception catching in the ASSERT_* macros

         * Changed the make system such that the test program is not
           built by default

         * Added string comparisons
           - regex for matching regular expressions
           - collate for locale dependent sort order

         * Added floating point comparisons
           - abs_diff for values near 0
           - relative_diff for large values

         * Code and documentation cleaning

2009-03-18 0.5.1

         * Fixed test case termination bug which caused gcov to
           malfunction

2009-03-15 0.5.0

         * Added ASSERT_PRED macro, which accepts as predicate
           anything that looks like a function returning a value
           usable as a boolean expression. Predicates can
           optionally define an output stream operator, which
           will be used in violation logs, if available.

         * Added a mechanism to send parameters to the test cases
           through the -p command line switch, and the get_parameter()
           family of static functions in test_case_factory.

         * Fixed bug in command line parsing.

2009-03-05 0.4.0

         * Test  cases now have a default real-time timeout of
           2000ms. This gives them a 3000ms run-time before they
           are killed. Change it upwards or downwards per test-
           case as required.

         * Updated the documentation on how to link when using
           crpcut with google-mock. The earlier described method
           no longer works.

         * Added a get_start_dir() function to test_case_factory,
           which can be used to query the working dir the test-program
           was started in. Since each test case runs in its own
           working dir, this information is otherwise lost once
           the test case creation has begun.

         * Changed the termination tag to violation, and added
           the attribute "phase" which may have either of the
           values "creating", "running", "destroying" and
           "post_mortem" which should make error pinpointing
           a bit easier.

         * Default stdout to human readable format and file output
           to XML. Added -x flag to invert.

         * A number of lib names are now chained when looking
           for a symbol to wrap. Please see the documentation for
           details.

         * No longer exposes the crpcut::wrapped functions - it was
           a major mistake. crpcut itself still wrapps all functions
           it needs in namespace crpcut::wrapped. For your test-
           cases, you wrap the functions you need in whatever
           namespace you please. Sorry for the inconvenience.

         * Sourceforge now hosts the GIT repo as well.
           git://crpcut.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crpcut

         * Fixed a number of bugs

2009-02-16 0.3.0

         * No XML output when running tests with -c 0 for debugging.

         * Improved documentation and source-level enforcement on
           how to link when using google-mock.

         * Use libc/librt functions from dlopen()/dlsym(), and wrap
           them in namespace crpcut.

         * Added macros for creating own function wrappers.

         * Output unstreamable expressions as hex dumps.

2009-02-08 0.2.0

         * Optional support for google-mock. See README_GOOGLE_MOCK for
           details.

         * Added INFO and FAIL output streamers from test cases.

           INFO << expr1 << expr2 << expr3

           Sends the streamed output to the result log, but does not
           change the state of the test.

           FAIL << exp1 << expr2 << expr3

           Immediately terminates the test case as failed, with the
           output streamed data as the error cause.

         * A number of new command line flags:

           -d flag for selecting named working directory

           -o flag to direct XML output to a named file

           -q flag for silencing summation print when -o is used

           Use -n flag instead of -d for nodeps

         * Fixed numerous problems with out-of-tree builds.

         * Improved selftest.
